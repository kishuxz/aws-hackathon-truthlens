# TruthLens â€” Scoring prototype

This repository contains a small prototype scorer for evaluating how well a post
is supported by external sources. It includes a deterministic local scorer and
an optional Bedrock-backed scoring flow (not required to run locally).

See the `Truthlens/` directory for the core policy, sample data, and scorer.
